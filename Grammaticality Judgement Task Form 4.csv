For instance, it's sometimes possible to have a mixed or combined antecedent if treal-world knowledge makes it plausible, but this plausibility drops (and I think acceptability to some degree--despite my knowledge that they're no less grammatical) as the referents and the relevant properties change, e.g. birds wearing shoes when everyone knows they only wear socks."
