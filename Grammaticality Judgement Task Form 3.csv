If there were a dummy ""do/did"" there before the ""too"", that would obviously fix things, but not without it. Where things like transitivity, animacy, context indicate the last NP should be Subj, I can kinda get the intended meaning, but it's not grammatical. And I can't get the ones like ""Duke will play Ohio and Penn Utah and Yale too"" really at all. Without the ""too"" I could get it as ""Duke will play Ohio and Penn will play Utah and Yale"", but with ""too"" there I'm not sure what Yale is supposed to be doing. "

Without knowing the details of what you’re looking for in particular it seems more natural to say “Russians enjoy tennis” rather than the country itself doing so, unless that throws more complications into the design of the experiment."
