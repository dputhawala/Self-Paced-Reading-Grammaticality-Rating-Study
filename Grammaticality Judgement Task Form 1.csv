I always wanted to insert a ""does so"" or the like to give the ellipsis a sensible meaning.

I think the instructions for the second task (the paraphrase task) might be a bit confusing.  In the cases where my interpretation was nonsensical (mother buying father), it seemed that giving a paraphrase was pointless, as the sentence did not generate reasonable meaning.  I am not sure what the solution would be; maybe give a nonsensical interpretation (the ""elephant in my pajamas"" example sentence is kinda like that, but it is a well-known joke and maybe doesn't seem so unusual for that reason).

By the time I got to task 2 I had habituated to these sentences and so i realized the intended elided meaning, though I wrote my initial interpretation since it was the first one that I got.

Let me also use this chance to put in a plug for online measures -- consider also recording people's reaction times, which may give insights that their metalinguistic judgments don't."
