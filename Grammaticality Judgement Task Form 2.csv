It seems like my answers don't have much to do with the syntax and are mostly about semantic plausibility.  Hopefully there's a method to be able to confirm/disconfirm a hypothesis like that independently of any syntactic condition. 

For the three-part conjuncts, those are pretty universally bad for me when you get traditional ellipsis for two conjuncts and the third just gets ""NP, too""  - will you have ""NP did, too"" as a control?"

Meghan wanted one of those cars (or both!) as well, and I would have had to ask the speaker which they meant to which one.","Much of my issue was that, despite knowing what the ""intended"" readings for these sentences were, for many the interpretation of a conjoined object rather than a subject+gapped VP was the more prevalent interpretation. This occurred even in spite of the fact that the gapping cases were often the more probable cases pragmatically."

You might want to tell the participant to go with their initial/gut reaction. Also, in the first task, none of the sentences were as ungrammatical as the example for (*). Maybe this was intentional, but I was left thinking that maybe I should go back and be less accepting of some of the ones that I marked as (?)."
